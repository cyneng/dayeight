	<h1>Day Eight</h1>
		<p>Making time to study and create a web site every single day while one has to work and deal with regular every day life is tough. </p>
	<h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
		<p>The format of css is different than html. An example is listed below. </p>
			<code>
			selector {  
			</code>
			<br>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <code>property: value;
			</code>
			<br>
			<code>}
			</code>
		<p>A <strong>selector</strong> can be any HTML element such as an img, table, or an h1. 
		<p>A <strong>property</strong> is an aspect of a selector. A <strong>value</strong> is  a setting for a property. So a property can be font-family, color, or font-size. A value can be blue, red, Verdana, Arial, etc.</p>
		<p>In order for the CSS to know that you are done with a <strong>property-value</strong>, you need to end each pair with a semi-colon.</p>
	<h1>Font Size</h1>
		<p>When specifying font sizes, you can do so in px (pixels) or ems. A pixel is a dot on the computer screen. Use px when assuming the screens of whoever is viewing your site is going to be of similar size. So that the user sees exactly what you see. IF a user is using a different size, use <strong>em</strong>s. </p>
		<p>An em is a relative measure. One em is equal to th default font size on whatever screen the user is viewing the site on. For a smartphone, 1em is the fontsize you normally use, .5em is half the size. </p>
	<h1>Height, Width, and Background Colors</h1>
		<p>In the overview,  three other properties touch on are background-color, height, and width - where height and width are set to pixels.</p>
		<div>
		</div>
		<h1>Borders!!</h1>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	<h1>Links and Text Decoration</h1>
		<p>You can change a lot of the properties of links, just like regular text. There is also a text-decoration property for links.</p>
